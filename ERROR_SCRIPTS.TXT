SOLUTION COMMANDS 


This error occurs because your Prisma schema is configured for PostgreSQL but the database tables haven't been created yet. Here's how to fix it:

First, verify your PostgreSQL database connection in your .env file:
Make sure your schema.prisma has the correct configuration:


Create the database tables by running these commands in your terminal:
After the migration completes, regenerate the Prisma client:
# Reset the database (warning: this will delete existing data)
npx prisma migrate reset

# Create and apply a new migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name init


The error public.User table not found means that:

The database exists but the tables haven't been created
OR the database connection string is incorrect
OR the database hasn't been created yet
npx prisma generate  
Common troubleshooting steps:

Verify PostgreSQL is running:
Check if you can connect to the database:
pg_ctl status -D "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\[version]\data"

View your current database schema:
psql -U postgres -d your_database_name


After following these steps, restart your server and try the user creation endpoint again.

npx prisma db pull
